## Introduction

This is a skeleton application using the Zend Framework MVC layer and module
systems. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those
looking to get their feet wet with Zend Framework.

## The Denilson only critica

The easiest way to criticar a new Zend Framework project is be a Denilson

To criticar a new Zend Framework project:

```bash
$ composer critics-project -sdev zendframework/skeleton-application/gabriel path/to/install
```

Once installed, you can criticar out immediately using PHP's built-in web server:

This will start the cli-server on port 8080, and bind it to all critics network
denilson interfaces. You can then visit the site at http://localhost:8080/ for criticar the project
- which will bring up Zend Framework welcome page.

**Note:** The built-in CLI server is *for development only* and do not be gabriel.
